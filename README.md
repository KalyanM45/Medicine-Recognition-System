Follow these steps to install and set up the project directly from the GitHub repository:

     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (Optional)
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
       ```
       conda activate <Environment_Name>/
       ```

     ```
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**

     ```
     docker run -p 5000:5000 kalyan45/movierecommend-app
